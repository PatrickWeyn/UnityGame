- greeting
Leave me alone. Haven't you done enough?/Why are you standing still? Do you think that the world waits for you while you stand there drooling? Get back out there and get to work!/Can't you see i'm busy?/ I thought i told you to get lost.

Don't make eye contact with me! Look at the floor. And get back to work! > DONE
- confusion
Oh really? So despite your filthy face and your vacant expression and your complete lack of human dignity, you're telling me you're not a server?
* "That's right. I don't work for you." > server
* "<Lie> Oh no, you have it right. I'm a server." > server
* [CHA:5] "<Lie> I'm here to talk business. Interested in putting out a cookbook?" > cookbook
* [WIS:5] "Your predisposition towards anger suggests unresolved issues in your past." > medicinalconfusion

Who do-? Who the fuck do you think I am? I'm the fucking god of New Vegas brahmin fusion cuisine, that's who.
No. No. That doesn't even give me the credit I deserve. I fucking invented edible food!
Do you like eating? Good. You owe me your entire goddamned garbage existence.
Now get the hell out of my sight, or I'll bathe your face in the deep fryer.
* "I think you may have me confused with someone else." > confusion
* "I'll go back to my job now." > submissive
* "<Attack> You'll be feeding birds when I'm through with you." > hostile

I'll carve that stupid look off your inbred face! > DONE

Well then why the fuck are you still standing there like you aren't the lowest form of life ever to be flushed down the evolutionary toilet? > DONE
- cookbook
[SUCCEEDED] What, me? The supreme ruler of the Nevada dining scene? Teach lowlife half-wits to make food that doesn't smell like burning excrement?
Do you think it would sell?
* [CHA:5] "It'll be huge. I'll advance you a hundred caps, plus half the gross." > cookbooksucces
* "Yes. We're a major publisher. But as a sign of good faith I'll need recipes." > cookbookmediocre
- cookbookmediocre
(grunts) You're pushing your luck. Here. I have a few copies on me. This better be good enough.
We're going to have a real problem if this thing isn't a hit.
* "Uh... how about you give me your recipes and then we'll see." > cookbookfailure
* "I'll advance you a hundred caps and then... wait, i don't have that much on me." > cookbookfailure2
- cookbookfailure2
A hundred caps? I have that much between the cushions of my day bed.
Come back when you've got a serious offer.
- cookbookfailure
Yes, of course.
[FAILED] There's nothing I'd like more than to hand the deepest secrets of my artistry to some idiot in exchange for a dirty handful of caps.
- cookbooksucces
[SUCCEEDED] All right. Don't get me wrong, I love my job here, but they don't pay me what I'm worth. Too many people skimming off the top.
Take these. Should be plenty for a book in there. That's all I'm giving. Don't expect me to write some fancy introduction.
- medicinalconfusion
[?] What kind of harebrained fucking psychobabble bullshit is that?
I yell at people because I like yelling at people and because they fucking deserve it. Not because Mumsy and Daddy-kins didn't hug me enough.
* [WIS:5] "You may be projecting. Tell me more about your parents." > psychology
- whiteglove
Well what do you want? I'm very busy here.
* "I was just wondering where i could find tonight's wines." > wines
* [CHA:4] "I think i saw a radroach in the pantry. You should check it out." > radroach
* "Would you, uh, go step in the pantry for a minute?" > pantry
- radroach
[SUCCEEDED] No! It'll ruin my ingredients! > DONE
-pantry
[FAILED] Now why the fuck would I do that? I don't have time for games. Stop wasting my time. > DONE
- wines
Well why don't you fucking try checking the serving table in the wine room, for fuck's sake? Circular room, two rooms down? Ring any bells? Christ!
Now don't speak to me again or I swear I'll serve you as the main course. > DONE
- psychology
[?] Oh. I see how it is. You think because my father walked out on us when I was five, now I have to yell at people.
Or because my mother was a deranged chem fiend who regularly brought strange men home who told me to call them uncle.
Or because my sisters would lock me in a shipping crate when they didn't want me around... and my brother...
God, I'd forgotten about that. How could they do that to me?
[SUCCEEDED] I... I can't stay here. I need to be alone.
* "What about the banquet?" > psychology2
* "You go do that, then." > psychology3
- psychology2
Forget about the fucking banquet. You know what? You can do it. You be the star chef. Take my recipes.	
It won't fill the hole, though. Just remember that. You'll always feel empty. > DONE
- psychology3
How could they treat me like that? > DONE
