You can talk rudely to people if you so desire, but remember that this has an influence on their behavior towards you.
Some people will appreciate this, others won't. It all depends on who you want to be in the game.
Characters will talk differently to you, and some options may be locked or unlocked.

You will notice their behavior change as their opinions of you change.
Characters will talk differently to you, and some options may be locked or unlocked.
